                After migrating legacy designs into our new PDM system — that I set up — and
                implementing configuration management processes, I provided production support,
                product enhancement, and DMSMS mitigation for the existing version. This included
                creating, prototyping, and implementing ECRs and ECPs to add customer-requested
                enhancements or address component obsolescence issues.
            </p>

                During FRACAS activities, I performed root cause analysis, testing, and corrective
                action resolution to failures. This included frequent data-driven experimentation
                and analysis to identify failure patterns and isolate the causes in a complex
                electrical system.

                I designed and prototyped a modernization stopgap, pictured above, to address
                accelerating component obsolescence ahead of the next product generation. While
                maintaining the same CONOPS and chassis, I replaced the internal components with
                current generation hardware. I built a demonstration prototype with enhanced user
                experience, such as a new display and touch screen technology, and improved
                performance with a modern instrument backplane and PXIe modules.
