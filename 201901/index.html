                I collaborated with an industrial automation software company to create and
                demonstrate a commercial solution for condition-based maintenance. It needed to be
                low enough cost to warrant installing data collection devices at a large number of
                sites; for example, monitoring dozens or hundreds of locations where a company has
                HVAC equipment. The solution was to use a Raspberry Pi computer module on a custom
                carrier board that included I/O for common commercial communication buses. The
                device would preprocess that data and send it to a central server running similar
                software for analysis.
