                One of my favorite uses for additive manufacturing is in printing masters — or
                patterns, plugs, or bucks depending on the industry — for mold making. In this case,
                we needed a custom adapter to connect a new sensor with an M8 electrical connector
                to our existing M12 cable harnesses. Because of the specific wiring requirement, no
                off-the-shelf adapters existed, and having another company manufacture them would
                have been cost prohibitive in our quantities.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                Instead, I designed an overmolded adapter and 3D printed a master. A part like this
                could be injection molded, but to keep costs down and let our existing,
                IPC-certified depot buildl these, I opted for a pour casting so that
                electrically-insulative epoxy resin could be simply pumped from a mixing nozzle into
                the mold. I finished the master and coated it with primer to avoid inhibiting the
                platinum cure mold silicone. After a few successful prototypes, and after testing
                the epoxy curing with and without release agent, we decided to move forward.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                At this point, we could have used the prototype mold to create working masters and
                additional molds, but I had some revision notes, and we wanted a durable, metal
                master that could be more securely fastened down to improve the mold quality. So, we
                ordered CNC machined aluminum masters, I made several final molds, and the
                manufacturing depot has been using them ever since to build adapters that are being
                used on customer sites to this day.
