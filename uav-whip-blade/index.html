                A series of breakaway whip antennas and blade antennas developed for UAV platforms.
                The whip antennas were shaped from nitinol wire, and I developed processes to
                fabricate them with precise jigs that held the shape memory alloy while the material
                was cycled through specific temperature profiles in a kiln. In some applications,
                customers needed several antennas installed in an array on the aircraft, so a common
                matching network housing design was adapted to each location using 3D-printed shims
                that accomodated the fuselage's organic curvatures.
